# GenericCSVGeocodingScript
This is a script for geocoding a CSV file full of addresses using the Geopy library.

# Requirements
To run this script you must have Python 2.7 and the GeoPy library installed.

# How to Use
This script uses command line prompts to gather information. It also asks for user verification of previously supplied information after every prompt.

The first prompt will ask for the file path to the CSV you want processed.
The second prompt will ask for the column headers of your CSV.
The third prompt will ask for the column number that the addresses you want to geocode reside in.
The fourth prompt will ask for a file path for the output CSV.
Then wait until the script finishes running and the geocoded addresses will be in the output CSV.
